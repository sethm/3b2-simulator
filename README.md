This is an AT&T 3B2/400 and 3B2/700 simulator.

----------------
The simulator framework used to control the 3B2 simulator, known as SCP
("Simulator Control Program"), is based on the SIMH project, originally written
by Robert M. Supnik. Many people have contributed to the SIMH project, and
I wish to thank them all for their work. The 3B2 simulator in its current
form would not be possible without them.
